            <h2>Full-stack used to mean less layers.</h2>

            <p>Coding php or Python, jQuery, HTML, CSS then transferring a few files via FTP to your shared hosting account or dedicated server? You were full-stack. HTML was trivial, and even thinking of implementing any proper application code in JavaScript wasn't possible.</p>

            <p>My beef is not with people who can do all of the above, it's with the label 'full-stack developer'. <strong>What does it mean in 2014?</strong></p>
            <p>At the level of a senior full-stack engineer we're perhaps talking about architecting a modular Backbone/AngularJS front-end whilst optimising content delivery and tweaking hardware accelerated layers in CSS, followed by implementing an async non-blocking backend (which also pre-renders templates on the server), and pushing to an AWS cluster which has been built with security and scaleability in mind. Not to mention design. Designing UI responsively and mobile-first is essential, utilising a CSS pre-processor to save time. And remember to setup Nagios for monitoring. Oh, and ideally when the Continuous Integration server detects a bad build because your end-to-end tests have failed, get it to send you an SMS with the build error messages. Well, the last two are probably for bonus points.</p>

        <p>Ask someone who labels themselves 'full-stack'. Do they believe they have familiarity with different layers, or true mastery?</p>
